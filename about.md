## About My Book

I'm the author of Anaconda's Prime, Book One of the Afturburn Series, which is a dystopian novel about ten companies taking over the world, leaving Mowgli and Asana in the crossfire.

Here's the Amazon excerpt for you: 

*It was 2030 when the Plague wiped out everything Mowgli knew and loved. Only a few days after the Plague bombs fell, hungry corporations seized control of the Union, and when the government collapsed, so did all law, order, and civility.

As society crumbles, Mowgli feels his life and family slipping away. Anaconda, the merciless tech conglomerate, has taken everything and everyone from him. Mowgli dedicates his life to one objectiveâ€”revenge.*

If you like *Hunger Games*, *Maze Runner*, *Percy Jackson*, or anything like that, it's somewhere in that category.

The other two books in the trilogy have been written, and the second has been edited, and I am still working on finishing publishing the trinity. 

## About My Work in AI

I am also an artificial intelligence engineer, working with various things like LLMs, RAG, reward models, model evaluations, MCP, and various other applications of AI. I currently work at Elevance Health. I enjoy building intelligent systems and exploring the potential of AI to solve complex problems.
